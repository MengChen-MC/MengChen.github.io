Hello! I am a successful Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) Postdoctoral
Fellowships (PF) grantee (UKRI Guarantee Funding) at the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge. I received a second Ph.D. in Energy Technology from Aalborg University in 2022, a first Ph.D. in Power System and Automation from North China Electric Power University in 2018, and a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering and Automation from Qingdao University of Science and Technology in 2013. From 2022 to 2023, I was a Postdoc at Aalborg University.

I am privileged to work with Prof. Ioannis Lestas on topics centered around power system stability and control with renewable energy.
